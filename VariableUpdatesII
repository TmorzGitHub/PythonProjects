aRubbingAlcoholPrice = 4  # This is the initial price set by retailer A

bRubbingAlcoholPrice = aRubbingAlcoholPrice + 1 # b increases the value to 1 higher than a

aRubbingAlcoholPrice = aRubbingAlcoholPrice + 2 # a relative increase in price of a by 2 above b

bRubbingAlcoholPrice = bRubbingAlcoholPrice - 0.5 # b reduced his previous price by 50 pence

aRubbingAlcoholPrice = bRubbingAlcoholPrice - 1.2 # a followed with a reduction of 1.2 relative to b

# b reduced his price by 20%.  Need to calculate the % first and then subtract
bRubbingAlcoholPrice = bRubbingAlcoholPrice - (bRubbingAlcoholPrice * 0.2)
